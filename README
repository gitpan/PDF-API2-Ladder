NAME
    PDF::API2::Ladder - Creates PDFs a line at a time, much like the rungs
    on a ladder.

SYNOPSIS
      use PDF::API2::Ladder;

      # Create a new PDF::Ladder Object
      $pdf = PDF::Ladder->new(   font_size       => $font_size,
                                 lead            => $lead,
                                 font            => 'Georgia',
                                 show_margins    => $show_margins,
                                 margin_top      => .5/in,
                                 margin_bottom   => .5/in,
                                 line_height     => $line_height);

      # Create a Rung at the top of the page (since its the first) that is center.
      $pdf->add_rung("An Amazing Play", align  => 'center');
      # Create a Rung underneath that, which is not centered
      $pdf->add_rung("Actor1: 'To be or not 2 B. That is the answer!');

DESCRIPTION
    PDF::API2::Ladder is a simplified way of creating PDFs using the awesome
    module PDF::API2. PDF::API2::Ladder builds PDFs in a top down fashion
    much like rungs on a ladder. The exception to the rung style is what is
    called a Blob. Blobs do not have a set height and adapt to their
    contents height instead. New pages are created automatically when a rung
    or blob goes off the end of the page.
